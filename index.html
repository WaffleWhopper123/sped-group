        The Weaknesses of Our Pillow(and how we overcame them)
    </h2>
    <ol class="font">
        <li>We were not able to expand into different regions of the bedding industry,<br> due to the limitations set by our company name.</li>
        <li>We also had some internal conflicts, since some people weren’t putting in the same amount of work as others. <br>Eventually though, everyone managed to pitch in the same amount of work after some consultation sessions.</li>
        <li>The concept is very innovative and people might not be willing to accept the creative idea.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Our Oppurtunities to make our pillow better (shhh! this is confidential dont tell any competitors(that's right we have confidential information on our public website)).
    </h2>
    <ol class="font">
        <li>People who wish to increase the control they have over their pillow’s temperature. (we're gonna put that in PilloeProMk2)</li>
        <li>Our supplier recently increased their production sites, allowing us to buy products for cheaper.</li>
        <li>A viral TikToker recently posted a video advertising our product, this has boosted our sales by a lot.</li>
        <li>Our competitors have internal issues, causing them to produce lower quality products and crash their company value.</li>
